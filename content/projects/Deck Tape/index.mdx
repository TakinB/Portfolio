When I look back, I remember every cassette tape that I owned and my emotions when listening to them. However, it wasn't the case with my digital album collections. So I started with the question of:  How can we bring the physical interaction that we had with cassette tapes into the modern way of listening to music? 

 Deck Tape is a tribute to cassette players. It's an audio visualizer that integrates sound, color, and touch using an Arduino Uno, DC motors, ring magnets, and iron filing.
