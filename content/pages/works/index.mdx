Having been driven by the search for novelty and empathy during my time as a multidisciplinary researcher and software engineer, I came to acknowledge the inherent and polyvalent affinity between engineering and design in achieving a common purpose: serving as an aid to human conditions and not as a luxury.

Currently, I am an MA/MS student in Innovation Design Engineering at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London.
